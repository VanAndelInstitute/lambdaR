# Overview

AWS Lambda now supports [bring your own runtime](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-use-any-programming-language-and-share-common-components/) via there minimalist runtime API. The basic idea is that you create a layer containing your runtime components, and an executable `bootstrap` script that glues together the task request and your runtime. Pretty basic in concept, but putting the pieces together for using the R runtime took a little effort.  The steps are described here. Note that you only need to do this once.  When you have a functional R runtime layer, you can use that layer for any lambda functions you create that require the R runtime.

# Limitations

The approach detailed below does not include support for Rcpp (nor installing packages requiring building from source during lambda function execution) as it does not include the build tools in the lambda layers. In theory, these dependencies could be included in another layer although I have not determined exactly what the minimum set of libraries and tools is at this point.

# Quick Start

Details are given below on building the runtime environment to generate the lambda layers required. These layers contain the system dependencies, R, and R packages (in three layers to keep each under the limit of 50M). However, the resulting layers are also included in this repository. For those not interested in the details, you can skip to [deployment](#deployment). 

# Building Tools and Dependencies

## Build Environment

We want to build our toolchain in the same environment used by Lambda.  So create an instance (it doesn't take much...t2.small or medium should be fine) based on the AMI used by Lambda, which as of this writing is this one: `amzn-ami-hvm-2018.03.0.20181129-x86_64-gp2`.  SSH to that instance and update the AWS client tools (the one that comes with that AMI does not know about Lambda layers):

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

```

You will also need the development tools, and, while we are at it, an editor:

```
sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
sudo yum -y install emacs-nox
```

Lambda copies the layer contents into `/opt`, so we will install things there to begin with (otherwise, R will get confused).  You will need to update your .bashrc so that the tools we build can find eachother. You should do this as root as we will need these variables available later when installing R packages as root. Here is how I have my root .bashrc configured (probably some of these lines are superfluous):

```
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin:/opt/lib:/opt/R/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/lib"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/lib"
export LD_RUN_PATH="$LD_RUN_PATH:/opt/lib"
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/opt/include"
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/opt/include"
export CPATH="$CPATH:/opt/include"
export LDFLAGS="-I/opt/lib"
```

Make sure you start a new bash session before continuing, so that these environment variables are loaded.

Finally, run `aws configure` to enter your AWS credentials so that you can push lambda layers up to AWS below. Note that the credentials you provide must be for an [IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) that has the AWSLambdaFullAccess permissions (you can actually be more granular than that, the key permission is lambda:PublishLayerVersion) and also IAMFullAccess to create roles and permissions for your Lambda functions (again, you can be more granular if you wish). You create a user and retrieve the user secret and key from the web console. 

## Building The Dependencies

I like to create a "build" directory and work in there.

```
mkdir ~/build
cd ~/build
```

R has a number of dependencies.  Rather than doing `yum install` and then trying to track down the pieces and put them in `/opt`, we will just build them and install into /opt. Note that each tools needs a unique combination of config flags and make commands to generate the desired shared libraries with necessary features installed in the /opt file tree.

```
# openssl
wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2q.tar.gz
tar -zxvf openssl-1.0.2q.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.0.2q
./config --prefix=/opt shared
make 
sudo make install
cd ..

# curl
wget https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.62.0.tar.gz
tar -zxvf curl-7.62.0.tar.gz
cd curl-7.62.0
./configure --prefix=/opt --with-ssl
make 
sudo make install
cd ..

# bzip2
wget -O bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz https://sourceforge.net/projects/bzip2/files/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz/download
tar -zxvf bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
cd bzip2-1.0.6
make -f Makefile-libbz2_so
sudo make install PREFIX=/opt
cd ..

# xz
wget https://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.4.tar.gz
tar -zxvf xz-5.2.4.tar.gz
cd xz-5.2.4
./configure --prefix=/opt
make 
sudo make install
cd ..

# pcre
wget https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/pcre-8.42.tar.gz
tar -zxvf pcre-8.42.tar.gz
cd pcre-8.42
./configure --prefix=/opt --enable-utf8 --enable-unicode-properties
make 
sudo make install
cd ..

# libxml2
wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-2.9.9.tar.gz
tar -zxvf libxml2-2.9.9.tar.gz
cd libxml2-2.9.9
./configure --prefix=/opt 
make 
sudo make install
cd ..

```

## Copying System Dependencies

There are a couple of libraries that were installed when we installed the Development Tools group that R depends on, but won't be there in the Lambda environment.  We will copy these into /opt/lib

```
sudo cp /usr/lib64/libgfortran.so.3 /opt/lib
sudo cp /usr/lib64/libquadmath.so.0 /opt/lib

```

## Building R

Now we will build R with most options inactivated (because layers must be <50MB zipped). You can tweak these options to suit your needs, but you may need to do additional pruning after building to get your zip file under 50MB.  Hopefully, larger layers will be supported by AWS in the future. Note that after issuing the "make" command, it is a good time to go get a cup of coffee.

```
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.0.2.tar.gz
tar -zxvf R-4.0.2.tar.gz
cd R-4.0.2
./configure --prefix=/opt/R --enable-R-shlib --with-recommended-packages --with-x=no --with-aqua=no \
	--with-tcltk=no --with-ICU=no --disable-java --disable-openmp --disable-nls --disable-largefile \
	--disable-R-profiling --disable-BLAS-shlib --disable-rpath --with-libpng=no --with-jpeglib=no --with-libtiff=no \
	--with-readline=no --with-pcre1
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

Let's prune a couple things out we don't need to stay under 50MB zipped.

```
sudo -s
cd /opt
rm -rf /opt/R/lib64/R/library/tcltk
rm -rf /opt/R/lib64/R/doc/manual
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/translations/en* /opt/R/lib64/R/library/
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/translations/DESCRIPTION /opt/R/lib64/R/library/
rm -rf /opt/R/lib64/R/library/translations/*
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/en* /opt/R/lib64/R/library/translations/
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/DESCRIPTION /opt/R/lib64/R/library/translations/
```

## Additional Libraries

We will add the aws.s3 library and its dependencies. However, to stay under size limits, we are going to want to install additional libraries under a separate directory.

```
sudo -s
mkdir -p /opt/local/lib/R/site-library
/opt/R/bin/R
install.packages("aws.s3", lib="/opt/local/lib/R/site-library")
q()
```

## Move Libraries

We need to move a couple of the base libraries to our site-library folder so each layer is under 50M

```
sudo -s
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/survival /opt/local/lib/R/site-library
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/Matrix /opt/local/lib/R/site-library
mv /opt/R/lib64/R/library/lattice /opt/local/lib/R/site-library

```

To allow use of these packages "out of the box", we need to edit `/opt/R/lib64/R/etc/Renviron` to comment out any existing R_LIB_USER definitions and add our site-library. 
The resulting passage of Renviron should look approximately like this:

```
R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'/opt/local/lib/R/site-library'}
#R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0'}
#R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/Library/R/4.0/library'}
```


# Bootstrap

We now need to create `/opt/bootstrap` that Lambda will call to kick off our new runtime.  While not complicated, the `bootstrap` script is the magic sauce that allows a wide range of runtimes to be shoe-horned into the Lambda architecture.  The `bootstrap` file below parses the handler specified by your Lambda functions (e.g. "test.handler"), reformats that to the name of an R script (e.g. "test.r") and then executes that script via `/opt/R/bin/Rscript`. (Note that the corresponding script must be provided along with your Lambda function.  When you create a new Lambda function using the AWS web console, you are prompted for a zip file containing this script. Alternatively, you can upload it at the command line as demonstrated below.) It also retrieves metadata about the request, and sends the response back to let Lambda know it is finished.  Create the following `bootstrap` file as root.

```
#!/bin/sh

# uncomment the following to stop execution on first error
#set -euo pipefail

# we can add python dependencies here later if needed
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/python

# Convert ".handler" to ".r" (isn't technically needed, but allows us 
# to name scripts with .r suffix like usual)
SCRIPT=$LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT/$(echo "$_HANDLER" | cut -d. -f1).r

while true
do
    # Get an event
    HEADERS="$(mktemp)"
    EVENT_DATA=$(curl -sS -LD "$HEADERS" -X GET "http://${AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API}/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/next")
    REQUEST_ID=$(grep -Fi Lambda-Runtime-Aws-Request-Id "$HEADERS" | tr -d '[:space:]' | cut -d: -f2)

    echo "About to run $SCRIPT"
    # Execute the handler function from the script
    RESULT=$(mktemp)
    /opt/R/bin/Rscript $SCRIPT
    RESPONSE="OK"

    # Send the response
    curl -X POST "http://${AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API}/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/$REQUEST_ID/response"  -d "$RESPONSE"
done
```
Save this as /opt/bootstrap, and don't forget to `chmod 755` it to make it executable.

Obviously, we could get a lot more fancy by sending the script as a payload with the function request, passing environment variables, sending results to S3, etc. etc.

# Package It Up

Due to size constraints, we need to put R, our extra libraries, and its dependencies in separate layers, so we create two zipfiles (moving the aws folder out of the way as we do so).

```
sudo -s
cd /opt
zip -r ../r.zip R
mv R ../
mv aws ../
zip -r ../r_lib.zip local
mv local ../local_hold
zip -r ../subsystem.zip *
mv ../R ./
mv ../aws ./
mv ../local_hold local
```

# Deployment 

## AWS Credentials

If you have skipped over the above steps and just want to use the pre-made layers included in this repo, make sure you have run `aws configure` to enter your AWS credentials (otherwise the below will not work). As noted above, the credentials you provide must be for an [IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) that has the AWSLambdaFullAccess permissions (you can actually be more granular than that, the key permission is lambda:PublishLayerVersion) and also IAMFullAccess to create roles and permissions for your Lambda functions (again, you can be more granular if you wish). You can create such a user and retrieve the user secret and key from the web console. 

## Push Layers To AWS

Assuming you have already run `aws configure` and entered your credentials, we can now push these lambda layers up to AWS.

```
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name subsystem --zip-file fileb://../subsystem.zip
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name R --zip-file fileb://../r.zip
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name r_lib --zip-file fileb://../r_lib.zip

```

Take note of the ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) returned by these functions as you will need them later to identify your layers. Note, however, you can always look them up later in the web console. Indeed, everything from this point forward can be accomplished [via the web console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html). However, using the AWC CLI from the command line is convenient for automation and documentation. Thefore, the command line approach will be demonstrated here. 

## Execution Role

You will need to create an AWS role with which to execute your lambda function. When you create a lambda function through the AWS web console, this role is created for you. But you can also do it from the command line. First create a file named `trust_policy.json` with these contents:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then run this command:

```
aws iam create-role --role-name Lambda-R-Role --asume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json
```

You can then create a new lambda function through the AWS web console or the command line client. You will need a handler (R script) to call. For starters, we can try:

```
print("Hello from planet lambdar")
```

Save that as test.r, and zip it.

```
zip test.zip test.r
```

Now we can deploy our function. Note the default timeout is 3 seconds which is not quite long enough for our runtime to load. We increase this to 10 seconds in the example below. (4 seconds is actually enough for this trivial example, but 10 will give more room for more complex functions. Very complex functions may require more time. The maximum execution time is 900 seconds.) Note also you will need to substitute the layer ARNs below with the actual ARNs returned by the [publish layer commands above](#push-layers-to-aws). 

```
aws lambda create-function \
    --role arn:aws:iam::436870896339:role/Lambda-R-Role \
    --layers "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:436870896339:layer:R:1" "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:436870896339:layer:r_lib:1" "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:436870896339:layer:subsystem:1" \
    --function-name lambda_r_test \
    --runtime provided \
    --timeout 10 \
    --zip-file fileb://test.zip \
    --handler test.handler
```

You can then go to the [lambda web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) and open your function. You can click "test" and create a new test event. For this basic function, you do not need any parameters, but you can leave the default key/value pairs listed. Alternatively, you can execute your function from the command line. The output will go to out.json in the example below.

```
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name lambda_r_test \
  --invocation-type RequestResponse \
  out.json  
```

If you want a little more detail then "OK",  you can request the log. However, this is returned base64 encoded, so must be decoded as follows (as demonstrated by pjb on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52555724)).

```
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name lambda_r_test \
  --invocation-type RequestResponse \
  --log-type Tail - | grep "LogResult"| awk -F'"' '{print $4}' | base64 --decode
```

This should give something like:

```
START RequestId: bc9de9a2-99aa-4a97-a602-8f4e087f1949 Version: $LATEST

# Troubleshooting

If the above does not work, examine the log messages. The most common problems I encounter relate to role permissions. Your lambda functions must run under an IAM role that has permission to execute lambda functions. As you add functionality in your R scripts, you will need to be sure the role has permissions to access any AWS resources your script needs (such as S3 access, etc.)
